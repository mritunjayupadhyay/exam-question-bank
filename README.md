## Description

This project is built using the NestJS framework and follows a serverless architecture, running on AWS Lambda. It integrates with various AWS services, including API Gateway, CloudWatch, and AWS Parameter Store, to ensure scalability and seamless management.

For the database, PostgreSQL is used in development within a Docker container, while Neon DB is chosen for production due to its fully serverless capabilities. The project employs Drizzle ORM for its lightweight and efficient database interactions.

```bash
$ npm install
```
